Back in 2018 there was a data breach in Marriot that ended up effecting over 300 million guests. The original breach happend back in 2014 but wasn't discovered until 2018. after aquiring another hotel business by the name of starwood hotels that had notice a couple attempts made to get into their internal database in 2018. The motives behind the attack are still unknown since no data was sold or attempt made to sell it. The way they got in was with email spoofing to get malware on specific pcs move laterally across the whole system. This flaw was made becasue the Starwood IT staff didn't pay any attention to it. Marriot ended up firing that IT team and hired new staff to rebuild the reservation system.
